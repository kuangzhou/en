Usually when we learn a new programming language, we will use "Hello World" as the first example. Thus here I just want 
to say hello world to write my first English passage in Github blog.

I have written "Hello World" in c, c++, Yi(易语言)，AHK, Python... When I started to learn Matlab and R, I did not use this
example. Interestingly, these two languages not evoked by "Hello World" are most familiar to me now. I am not the one who 
can master something new very quickly, but I will insist to learn and believe one day I will be qualified to say 
why this language is better than others or the opposite.

Great things comes small beginnings. Maybe there is some period that is sure to be wasted by yourself. Do not regret for that. 
Keep on fighting and be constancy to the purpose, even at the right time  the only thing you know is "Hello World".
